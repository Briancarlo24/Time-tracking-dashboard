## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned and practiced how to use external JSON file using the async JS and fetch method.

<!-- Proud of this function -->

```js
[...clicked.parentElement.children].forEach((btn) => {
  if (btn != clicked) btn.classList.remove("option__tab--active");
});
```

### Continued development

I will focus more on manipulating JSON file using the async functions and fetching external files.
